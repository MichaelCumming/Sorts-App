###Sorts

Sorts-App is the work I did at a post doc at the Technical University of Delft (2001-2005). This work was coded in Java. (see: sorts/src/sortsApp).

This research has its origin at Carnegie Mellon Univerisity in Pittsburgh. My boss in Delft (Dr. Rudi Stouffs) and his collaborator in Pittsburgh (Dr. Ramesh Krishnamurti) were working together on an idea called 'Sorts.' There is a paper in the repository which explains sorts. 

Sorts is related to a research field called 'shape grammars' which was a specialty of the Computational Design faculty at CMU. Both Krishnamurti and Stouffs are well-known in this community.
